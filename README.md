# Employee Management System
Users are able view all employees, add employee, and update employee roles.
All employees are able to have different roles, salary and departments.

For this project I was not able to run MySQL workbench 8.0. I did how ever use PHPmyadmin which was very similiar. I started by creating my database and then useing NODE to start my application. Below I have provided a video walkthrough as well as screenshots.
